For every additional element:

- We are adding three firewalls for added security to protect the site from malicious traffic and attacks.
- We are adding an SSL certificate to serve the site over HTTPS, which encrypts data in transit and provides added security for user information.
- We are adding three monitoring clients to collect data on site performance, identify issues and errors, and prevent downtime.

Firewalls are used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic to a network, providing an added layer of security to the site.

Serving traffic over HTTPS encrypts data in transit between the server and the client, providing an added layer of security to the site and protecting user information from unauthorized access.

Monitoring is used to identify issues and errors with the site, prevent downtime, and ensure that the site is performing optimally.

The monitoring tool collects data through monitoring clients installed on the servers, which collect and send data to a data collector for analysis and reporting.

To monitor web server QPS, you can use a monitoring tool that tracks the number of requests per second (QPS) and alerts you if the QPS exceeds a certain threshold.

The issues with this infrastructure are:

- Terminating SSL at the load balancer level can be an issue because it requires the decryption and re-encryption of data, which can cause performance issues and increase the risk of security vulnerabilities.
- Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes can be an issue because it creates a single point of failure and increases the risk of data loss if the server fails.
- Having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) might be a problem because it increases the risk of all servers failing at once, leading to site downtime and lost revenue. It's important to have redundancy and failover mechanisms in place to ensure site availability and performance.
