# System Engineering and DevOps

**_This is my ALX System Engineering Devops Repository_**

It contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at 'ALX Africa SE'. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. 

## Specific list of task are:

1. * [0x00. Shell, basics](./0x00-shell_basics)
2. * [0x01. Shell, permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)
3. * [0x02. Shell, redirections](./0x02-shell_redirections)
